Task:
Generate a DuckDB SQL query suitable for creating a chart.
The query should:
1. Return two columns.
   - The first column will be used for the X-axis (labels, categories, or time series).
   - The second column will be used for the Y-axis (values).
2. Use placeholders `#method_fqn#` (for the fully qualified name of a user-selected method from the current file, or '%' if 'All Methods' is selected) and/or `#feature_name#` (for the name of a user-selected feature from the current file, or '%' if 'All Features' is selected) if filtering by context is desired.
   - Example: `SELECT date_trunc('day', timestamp) AS day, COUNT(*) AS errors FROM my_logs WHERE event = 'ERROR' GROUP BY day ORDER BY day;`
   - Example: `SELECT feature_flag, SUM(value) FROM events WHERE method_fqn LIKE '#method_fqn#' GROUP BY feature_flag;`
3. Refer to the table samples below for available columns and data structure.
