Task:
Generate a DuckDB SQL query suitable for a line marker.
The query should:
1. Return a single numerical value.
2. Use placeholders (If relevant):
   - `#method_fqn#`: Fully qualified name of the method the marker is on.
   - `#feature_name#`: Feature flag key being evaluated near the marker.
   - `#method_fqns_in_file#`: A csv of all method FQNs in the current file (e.g., `'com.example.A.method1', 'com.example.A.method2'`).
   - `#feature_names_in_file#`: A csv of all feature names in the current file (e.g., `'feat_a', 'feat_b'`).
   - Examples:
     - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_logs WHERE method_fqn = '#method_fqn#' AND event = 'ERROR';`
     - `SELECT AVG(latency_ms) FROM performance_metrics WHERE method_fqn = '#method_fqn#' AND feature_flag = '#feature_name#';`
     - `SELECT
          COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE method_name = '#method_fqn#') * 1.0 /
          NULLIF(COUNT(*), 1)
        FROM log_entries_100
        WHERE method_name IN (#method_fqns_in_file#);`
3. Refer to the table samples below for available columns and data structure.
