Task:
Generate a DuckDB SQL query suitable for a line marker.
The query should:
1. Return a single numerical value.
2. Use placeholders `#method_name#` (for the fully qualified name of the method the marker is on) and/or `#feature_name#` (if relevant, for the feature flag key being evaluated near the marker) where appropriate.
   - Example: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_logs WHERE method_name = '#method_name#' AND event = 'ERROR';`
   - Example: `SELECT AVG(latency_ms) FROM performance_metrics WHERE method_name = '#method_name#' AND feature_flag = '#feature_name#';`
3. Refer to the table samples below for available columns and data structure.

_No extra commentaryâ€”SQL only._
